            In fact, (RN) Famous (recipe) is one of our unexpected specialties.
             Reminiscent of butcher shops back in the day, each slow-smoked, sizzling prime chop measures seven-fingers high. 
             Our signature recipe, that we have perfected for more than four decades, is rubbed with a secret blend of seasonings, cured and roasted on a rotisserie with pecan wood for up to six hours before it’s topped with (RN) signature herb-garlic butter, then carved tableside.
         </p></b></i>
